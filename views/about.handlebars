                <p>Hiya, my name is Emily! Iâ€™m a third year student at UC San Diego, pursuing a degree in Cognitive Science: Human-Computer Interaction and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>While my focus is UX engineering, I enthusiastically engage in projects from design to implementation. Currently, I work as a web developer for UCSD Information Technology Services and am a visual designer and student leader at <a href="https://designatucsd.org/" target="_blank">Design at UCSD.</a></p>
                <p>Other things I do include playing Stardew Valley and consuming alarming amounts of seafood. Full disclosure: I support House Stark, Team Iron Man, and pineapple on pizza.</p>
