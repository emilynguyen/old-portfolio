This approach sets the app apart from its competitors by providing users a more fun, personalized stretching experience.</p><p>To encourage users to actually perform the stretches provided by the app, we decided to include a social feature.

However, I faced an inconvenient situation: I had switched into UC San Diego’s human-computer interaction program at the beginning of my third year. With less formal experience and project courses under my belt than my peers, <i>how do I build a compelling portfolio?</i> If not through UX projects, <i>in what other ways can I convey my understanding of the human-centered design process?</i></p>"

Through this competitive analysis, I confirmed that it was essential to have a strong sense of visual design and a unique brand. The defining characteristic of a solid portfolio, however, was the designer’s ability to communicate their thought process and approach <i>through story</i>. Some of my favorites are <a href=\"http://amandashearon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">amandashearon.com</a>, <a href=\"http://melaniedaveid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">melaniedaveid.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://chris-liu.me/\" target=\"_blank\">chris-liu.me</a>.</p><p>Because storytelling plays such a fundamental role in UX, I decided to include graphic design projects in my portfolio to provide more insight into my process. I particularly chose those that involved branding, as they presented many opportunities for me to walk through my design decisions. While these graphic design projects do not explicitly showcase my UX skills, they illustrate how I use research to derive visual solutions that satisfy client needs.</p><p>On top of communicating my understanding of design thinking, I also needed to demonstrate my skill set in both visual design and coding. The solution here was obvious: build my portfolio from scratch.</p>"

After receiving formal education in an <a href=\"http://ixd.ucsd.edu/home/w18/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">interaction design course</a>, I performed a complete overhaul of my website. Tools I used to develop the current version of my portfolio are:</p><ul><li>Node.js + Express + Handlebars</li><li>Sass</li><li>Gulp + Autoprefixer</li></ul><p>The biggest change between my first and second iteration was my switch to the Handlebars templating engine. Since the bulk of my portfolio is a set of identically laid out case studies, it was the perfect tool. By templating this page, I significantly reduced clutter and made adding new projects painless.
