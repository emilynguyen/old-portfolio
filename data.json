I particularly chose those that involved branding, as they presented many opportunities for me to walk through my design decisions. While these graphic design projects do not explicitly showcase my UX skills, they illustrate how I use research to derive visual solutions that satisfy client needs.</p><p>On top of communicating my understanding of design thinking, I also needed to demonstrate my skill set in both visual design and coding.

I explored several different concepts, but felt that none of them captured myself as a designer. I didn’t want to <i>just</i> get the job done; my work is an extension of myself, and I needed to set the right visual tone. So, I took a step back to think about my brand and scrapped everything for a fresh start.</p>"

For my color palette, I stuck with neutrals and used a deep peach accent sparingly to ensure that my projects are centerplace. <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/YM3HRU3N9EB/\" target=\"_blank\">View mood board</a>.</p>",

My first time around, I used my self-taught knowledge of Sass, Bootstrap and AngularJS to achieve a smooth, responsive site. My web development skills have since come a long way, and I found my initial code to be messy and inefficient. My portfolio also did not have functionality that benefited from using a framework as complex as AngularJS. After receiving formal education, I performed a complete overhaul of my website. Tools I used to develop the current version of my portfolio are:</p><ul><li>Node.js (Express + Handlebars)</li><li>Sass</li><li>Gulp (Nodemon, BrowserSync, Sass, Autoprefixer)</li></ul><p>The biggest change between my first and second iteration was my switch to the Handlebars templating engine. Since the bulk of my portfolio is a set of similarly laid out case studies, it was the perfect tool. By templating this page, I significantly reduced clutter and made adding new projects painless. I also wanted my website to be pixel-perfect, so I decided against using Bootstrap to allow for more control. <a href=\"https://github.com/emnguyen/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">View on Github</a>.</p>"
