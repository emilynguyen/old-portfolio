The task at hand was to create a simple portfolio website to accompany my resume, where I’d present my projects and provide potential employers easy access to my online platforms. However, I faced an inconvenient situation; I had switched into UC San Diego’s human-computer interaction program at the beginning of my third year. With less formal experience and project courses under my belt than my peers, <i>how do I build a compelling portfolio?</i> If not through UX projects, <i>in what other ways can I convey my understanding of the human-centered design process?</i></p>"

					"title" : "Research + Solution",
					"text" : true,
					"content" : "<p>To begin answering this question, I combed through the portfolios of seasoned UI/UX designers to figure out what made them successful in landing positions. Through this competitive analysis, I confirmed that it was essential to have a strong sense of visual design and a unique brand. The defining characteristic of a solid portfolio, however, was the designer’s ability to communicate their thought process and approach through story. Some of my favorites are <a href=\"http://amandashearon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">amandashearon.com</a>, <a href=\"http://melaniedaveid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">melaniedaveid.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://chris-liu.me/\" target=\"_blank\">chris-liu.me</a>.</p><p>Because storytelling plays such a fundamental role in UX, I decided to include graphic design projects in my portfolio to provide more insight into my process. I particularly chose those that involved branding, as they presented many opportunities for me to walk through my design decisions. While these graphic design projects do not explicitly showcase my UX skills, they illustrate how I use research to derive visual solutions that satisfy client needs.</p><p>On top of demonstrating my understanding of design thinking, I also needed to showcase my skill set in both visual design and coding. The solution here was obvious: build my portfolio from scratch.</p>"

I knew I’d be including diverse projects in my portfolio, and thus the layout for my case studies would have more complex page elements in play. Content I needed to account for included basic text and image sections, but also color palettes and PDFs. Moreover, these sections would be chunks of the overarching story. With this in mind, I began conceptualizing layouts that had clearly defined content blocks.</p>"

Moreover, my color palette would be neutral to ensure that my projects are centerplace. <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/YM3HRU3N9EB/\" target=\"_blank\">View mood board</a></p>"

My first time around, I used my self-taught knowledge of Sass, Bootstrap and AngularJS to achieve a smooth, responsive site. My web development skills have since come a long way, and I found my initial code to be messy and inefficient. My portfolio also did not have functionality that benefited from using a complex framework like AngularJS. After receiving formal education in an interaction design course, I performed a complete overhaul of my website. Tools I used to develop the current version of my portfolio are:</p><ul><li>Sass</li><li>Node.js + Express + Handlebars</li></ul><p>The biggest change between my first and second iteration was my switch to the Handlebars templating engine. Since the bulk of my portfolio is a set of identically laid out case studies, it was the perfect tool. By templating these pages, I significantly reduced clutter and made adding new projects painless. I also wanted my website to be pixel-perfect, so I decided against using Bootstrap to allow for more control. <a href=\"https://github.com/emnguyen/emnguyen.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">View on Github</a></p>"
