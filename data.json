While these graphic design projects do not explicitly showcase my UX skills, they illustrate how I use research to derive visual solutions that satisfy client needs.</p><p>On top of communicating my understanding of design thinking, I also needed to demonstrate my skill set in both visual design and coding.

I explored several different concepts, but felt that none of them captured myself as a designer. I didnâ€™t want to <i>just</i> get the job done; my work is an extension of myself, and I needed to set the right visual tone. So, I took a step back to think about my brand and scrapped everything for a fresh start.</p>"

For my color palette, I stuck with neutrals and used a deep peach accent sparingly to ensure that my projects are centerplace. <a href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/YM3HRU3N9EB/\" target=\"_blank\">View mood board</a>.</p>",

My first time around, I used my self-taught knowledge of Sass, Bootstrap and AngularJS to achieve a smooth, responsive site. My web development skills have since come a long way, and I found my initial code to be messy and inefficient. My portfolio also did not have functionality that benefited from using a framework as complex as AngularJS. After receiving formal education, I performed a complete overhaul of my website. Tools I used to develop the current version of my portfolio are:</p><ul><li>Node.js (Express + Handlebars)</li><li>Sass</li><li>Gulp (Nodemon, BrowserSync, Sass, Autoprefixer)</li></ul><p>The biggest change between my first and second iteration was my switch to the Handlebars templating engine. Since the bulk of my portfolio is a set of similarly laid out case studies, it was the perfect tool. By templating this page, I significantly reduced clutter and made adding new projects painless. I also wanted my website to be pixel-perfect, so I decided against using Bootstrap to allow for more control. <a href=\"https://github.com/emnguyen/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">View on Github</a>.</p>"
